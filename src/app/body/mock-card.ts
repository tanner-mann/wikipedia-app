    text: "The Jane Byrne Interchange (previously known as the Circle Interchange) is a major freeway interchange in Chicago, in the U.S. state of Illinois. Located just outside the Chicago Loop, it is the junction between the Dan Ryan Expressway, the Kennedy Expressway, the Eisenhower Expressway, and the Ida B. Wells Drive. In a dedication ceremony held on August 29, 2014, the interchange was renamed in honor of Jane Byrne, a former mayor of Chicago. This video shows a moving aerial view of traffic on the Jane Byrne Interchange, shortly before the completion of a reconfiguration of the junction that was begun in 2013. "
